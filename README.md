Campus e-Whiteboards.

Users can sign in (using a very basic authentication system) and create whiteboards at any location on the Dartmouth campus map or join an existing whiteboard.  Once there, users can leave messages on the board.

TODO:
- authentication system (done... small bug in session id to track down)
- setup database and plug it into the views (done... just gotta make some views)
- templating (<--- all that's left)
