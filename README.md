Campus e-Whiteboards.

Users can sign in (using a very basic authentication system) and create whiteboards at any location on the Dartmouth campus map or join an existing whiteboard.  Once there, users can leave messages on the board.

TODO:
- CSS to make the messageboard view and the forms prettier
- 404 handling (invalid messageboard, etc)
